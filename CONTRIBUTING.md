## What should I know and do before I get started?

The software iCanSort is a learning tool to help students study and visualise sorting algorithms and their correctness available on Windows and macOS. This project i-can-sort is built with React and Electron based on NodeJS with npm.


### Download & Install NodeJS and npm

You can follow the link below to download for Windows and Mac. Note that npm will be downloaded and installed together with Node, so here we only provide you the link to download Node.

For **Windows 64-bit**, you can download and install:

- [https://nodejs.org/dist/v15.6.0/node-v15.6.0-x64.msi](https://nodejs.org/dist/v15.6.0/node-v15.6.0-x64.msi)

For **Mac**, you can download and install:

- [https://nodejs.org/dist/v15.6.0/node-v15.6.0.pkg](https://nodejs.org/dist/v15.6.0/node-v15.6.0.pkg)

Or you can find downloads that fits your system here by yourself:

- [https://nodejs.org/dist/v15.6.0/](https://nodejs.org/dist/v15.6.0/)

Now you shall be able to execute `node -v` in your terminal and see `v15.6.0`

### Clone or Download i-can-sort

For clone the project, you can use both HTTPS or SSH. Please make sure you have configured SSH in your machine and GitHub if you want to use SSH.

- HTTPS: `git clone https://github.com/team10nb/i-can-sort.git`
- SSH: `git clone git@github.com:team10nb/i-can-sort.git`

### Configuration Guide

In the project directory, you should run following command in your **terminal** in order to configure the dependencies. 

#### `cd PATH-TO-ROOT-OF-ICANSORT`

Goes to the directory which is the root of this project folder you downloaded
#### `npm install -g npm@6.14.10`

To install the specific npm version 6.14.10

#### `npm -v`

Make sure that you see `6.14.10` in your terminal.
To ensure that you install the specific npm version 6.14.10. 

#### `npm install`

Installs all the develepment dependencies.

If this step took more than 10 minutes, you shall consider to connect to eduroam or open a VPN and set proxy for npm.\
`npm config set proxy http://server:port`
`npm config set https-proxy http://server:port`

*Note that using a mirror may result in some error for some reason. Please use official registry.*


### Available Scripts

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Now you shall see iCanSort in your bowswer.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run electron-start`

- For more information about the styleguide, please visit the official website of [Styleguide (hugeinc.github.io)](https://hugeinc.github.io/styleguide/)

### Git Commit Styleguide

Use angular style.
`<type>(<scope>): <subject>`

`fix(Main): fix function call`


## Summary of quality assurance

### Coding Convention

The styleguides in the previous chapter includes our coding convention. We follow the guide we defined, which makes the structure clear and code clean.
### Independent quality assurance team

The team has two members who are mainly responsible for UI design, and they are also responsible for quality assurance.

The two members monitored coding process of the project, including structure, testing, documentation.

They also conducted Release Testing and Acceptance Testing by their own. They checked whether the system worked as the plan expected and remind technical team if there is anything wrong.

### Peer Programming

The team did peer programming for each piece of code. Each component we built was coded by two people. One would be monitoring while the other was coding. That is an effective method to advoid problems, such as wrong naming, missing semicolon, and no comments.


### Automated Unit Testing and Integration Testing

For each component and three main pages, unit tests and integration tests are written. The tests will be automatically conducted by script `npm test`.

### Release Testing and Acceptance Testing

Our quality assurance team conducted release testing after all the necessary features were done. Our stakeholders participated in the acceptance testing.

### Continuous Integration

A CI server on GitHub is utilised to conduct tests every time there is a push request. The team will receive email from GitHub if tests failed and will fix problems at once.

### Issue and Kanban

The team utilised Issue and kanban to track tasks and report bugs.
