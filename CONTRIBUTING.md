## What should I know and do before I get started?

The software iCanSort is a learning tool to help students study and visualise sorting algorithms and their correctness available on Windows and macOS. This project i-can-sort is built with React and Electron based on NodeJS with npm.


### Download & Install NodeJS and npm

You can follow the link below to download for Windows and Mac. 

For **Windows 64-bit**, you can download and install:

- [https://nodejs.org/dist/v15.6.0/node-v15.6.0-x64.msi](https://nodejs.org/dist/v15.6.0/node-v15.6.0-x64.msi)

For **Mac**, you can download and install:

- [https://nodejs.org/dist/v15.6.0/node-v15.6.0.pkg](https://nodejs.org/dist/v15.6.0/node-v15.6.0.pkg)

Or you can find downloads that fits your system here by yourself:

- [https://nodejs.org/dist/v15.6.0/](https://nodejs.org/dist/v15.6.0/)

Now you shall be able to execute `node -v` in your terminal and see `v15.6.0`

### Git Commit Styleguide

Use angular style.
`<type>(<scope>): <subject>`

`docs(README): fix grammar`

`fix(Main): fix function call`


## Summary of quality assurance

### Coding Convention

The team has made commit style:

`<type>(<scope>): <subject>`

`docs(README): fix grammar`

`fix(Main): fix function call`

Coding will be styled by Prettier.
### Independent quality assurance team

The team has two members who are mainly responsible for UI design, and they are also responsible for quality assurance.

The two members monitored coding process of the project, including structure, testing, documentation.

They also conducted Release Testing and Acceptance Testing by their own. They checked whether the system worked as the plan expected and remind technical team if there is anything wrong.

### Automated Unit Testing and Integration Testing

For each component and three main pages, unit tests and integration tests are written. The tests will be automatically conducted by script `npm test`.

### Release Testing and Acceptance Testing

Our quality assurance team conducted release testing after all the necessary features were done. Our stakeholders participated in the acceptance testing.

### Continuous Integration

A CI server on GitHub is utilised to conduct tests every time there is a push request. The team will receive email from GitHub if tests failed and will fix problems at once.

### Issue and Kanban

The team utilised Issue and kanban to track tasks and report bugs.
